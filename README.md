# Cn2app

This Eclipse Java project is a part of my bachelor thesis. Although this README is in English, the theses is written in Czech.

GUI app accesses Openweathermap API and Apify API to download weather data, which it uses to calculate refractive index structure parameter Cn2.

App was build using Eclipse IDE with WindowBuilder extension. Is works in symbiosis with a group of scripts and datasets in Apify cloud. Paid plans were used both for Apify and Openweathermap services.

User can display predicted values, generate charts of predicted values, past values and compare them. App allows adding new locations to the system.
